This is a fork of what seems to be the latest official atftp code
base on sourceforce (https://sourceforge.net/p/atftp/).

As of now I don't plan on extending atftp but just fix bugs, due
to time constraints. The one exception is the rollover patch
to support large file transfers, taken from a PR to opsi-atftp
(https://github.com/opsi-org/opsi-atftpd/pull/1)

Feel free to open issues for any problems you encounter. Since
I'm not at all familiar with the code base there's some chance
something broke though my patching, although the test.sh from
the test directory still reports that all is well.

The motivation for this repo was that we suddenly encountered
frequent crashes under high load which were easily reproduced
and tracked down to a race condition.
Researching revealed that there seems to be no active maintainer
for atftp, nor did I find any forks that try to address any
of the bugs that have been reported on the original sourceforge
project page.
Regarding the state of atftp we're currently considering moving
away from it. Until we've decided on a replacement, this is the
version that's running in production.

    -----------------

atftp stands for Advanced Trivial File Transfer Protocol. It is called
"advanced", by contrast to others TFTP servers, for two reasons.
Firstly, it is intended to be fully compliant with all related
RFCs. This include RFC1350, RFC2090, RFC2347, RFC2348 and RFC2349. To
my knowledge, there is no TFTP server currently available in the
public domain that fulfills this requirement. Secondly, atftp is
intended for serving boot files to large clusters. It is
multi-threaded and support multicast (RFC2090 and PXE), allowing
faster boot of hundreds of machine simultaneously.

I started writing the atftp server after trying to boot Debian from
the LAN using pxelinux (distributed with syslinux). Since pxelinux
needs support for the "tsize" option defined in RFC2349, I looked for
different TFTP servers but found none that fulfilled my needs.

With atftp, I have successfully used pxelinux and dhcpd to boot from
the LAN. Unfortunately, new development will slow down since I do it
on my spare time and atftp now does what I need.  However, atftp is
actively maintained. Comments, bug reports and patches are welcome.

Great thanks to my brother Remi who works on the client and server
implementation and the debian packaging.
